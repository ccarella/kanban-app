# Testing Setup Summary

## Overview
Your Kanban app now has a comprehensive testing setup using Jest and React Testing Library.

## What's Included

### Testing Framework
- **Jest** - JavaScript testing framework
- **React Testing Library** - For testing React components
- **@testing-library/user-event** - For simulating user interactions
- **ts-jest** - TypeScript support for Jest
- **jest-environment-jsdom** - DOM environment for testing

### Test Coverage
- ✅ **50 tests** across 5 test suites
- ✅ **71.98% line coverage**
- ✅ **69.63% statement coverage**
- ✅ **66.1% function coverage**
- ✅ **63.73% branch coverage**

### Test Structure
```
src/
├── app/__tests__/
│   └── actions.test.ts          # Server action tests
├── components/__tests__/
│   ├── BoardClient.test.tsx     # Main board component tests
│   ├── KanbanCard.test.tsx      # Card component tests
│   └── KanbanColumn.test.tsx    # Column component tests
├── lib/__tests__/
│   └── utils.test.ts            # Utility function tests
└── test-utils/
    ├── mock-data.ts             # Mock data factories
    └── render.tsx               # Custom render with providers
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode (for development)
npm run test:watch

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

### Key Features Tested
- ✅ Component rendering and interactions
- ✅ Drag and drop functionality (mocked)
- ✅ Server actions (moveCard, addCard, updateCard)
- ✅ Modal interactions
- ✅ Form submissions
- ✅ LocalStorage persistence
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Redis operations (mocked)

### Testing Patterns Used
1. **Custom render function** - Includes all necessary providers (DndContext)
2. **Mock data factories** - Consistent test data generation
3. **User event simulation** - Realistic user interactions
4. **Async testing** - Proper handling of promises and state updates
5. **Test isolation** - Each test runs independently

### Next Steps
To improve test coverage further, you could:
1. Add tests for the board page component
2. Add tests for UI components (button, card, input)
3. Add integration tests for the full drag-and-drop flow
4. Add E2E tests using Playwright or Cypress

The testing infrastructure is now in place and ready for expansion as your application grows!
